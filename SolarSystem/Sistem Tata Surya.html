            <p>The sun is an important member in the solar system which is the main component in
                solar system. The sun is also referred to as the parent in the solar system. The sun has
                332,830 Earth masses in size. By having this large mass size
                giving rise to a large core density in order to support the continuity of nuclear fusion
                and generates a tremendous amount of energy.</p>
            <p>Then this energy is emitted into space electromagnetic radiation and includes
                magnetic spectrum. The sun also has layers, namely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The core is the innermost layer of the sun
                        temperature of 14 million kelvin, and these cores are where nuclear reactions occur
                        which will produce a very large amount of energy.</li>
                    <li>The photosphere is the layer that still has tremendous heat energy at its temperature
                        about 6000 kelvin which has a thickness of about 300 km. And the photosphere is
                        part of the sun that can be seen, but we can not always look at the sun
                        directly as it may cause eye damage.</li>
                    <li>The chromosphere is the layer of the sun's atmosphere which has a temperature of 4,500
                        kelvin and has a thickness of 2,000 kilometers.</li>
                    <li>The corona is the outer layer of the sun that doesn't give off much heat energy
                        because the corona has a temperature of 1 million kelvin and has a thickness of 700,000 km.
                        The heat energy that is always emitted by the sun allows life to exist on Earth
                        earth. And without the reflection of sunlight. So we can't see
                        the other members of the solar system only look like stars,
                        meteors and comets.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

            <li>Planet</li>
            <p>Apart from the sun, there are also members of other celestial bodies, namely the planets.
                Planets are members of the celestial bodies that have several variations with shape and
                a certain size on the planet. There are 7 planets namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
                jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune which have variations with a certain size shape on
                every planet.</p>
            <p>With so many mysteries and interesting phenomena that exist in the universe, the solar system,
                as well as the sky world, which until now is still unknown to researchers
                many people are interested in learning more about this. How one
                natural phenomena occur and much more.</p>
            <p>Inner planets are planets whose orbits are close to the Sun, namely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mercury</li>
                    <li>Venus</li>
                    <li>Earth</li>
                    <li>Mars</li>
                </ul>
             <p>Outer planets are planets whose orbits are far from the Sun, namely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jupiter</li>
                    <li>Saturn</li>
                    <li>Uranus</li>
                    <li>Neptune</li>    
                </ul>
        </ol>
